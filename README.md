# InnoPlateReader

InnoPlateReader is a Web-based system designed to detect and read vehicle license plates using images. InnoPlateReader implements the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and read license plates. InnoPlateReader uses TailwindCSS technology as a front-end framework and Flask as a back-end framework. InnoPlateReader has also used Docker technology to deploy applications.


## Main Features
- **Home Page:** The start page of the InnoPlateReader system.
- **About Page:** Contains detailed information about InnoPlateReader.
- **Read Plate Page:** The page to perform the license plate detection process by uploading an image. The result of the detection will be displayed and the user can save the result.
- **Upgrade Model Page:** A page to upgrade the model by uploading a dataset containing images and labels (“.txt”), and specifying the epoch and confidence values. The system will display the training results such as confusion matrix and the user can save the new model results.


## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8:** An object detection algorithm used to detect license plates.
- **OCR:** Technology for reading characters on license plates.
- **TailwindCSS:** Front-end framework used for website design and layout.
- **Flask:** A back-end framework used to manage server workflows and APIs.
- **Docker:** Platform for packaging, distributing, and running application in isolated container.

    ```
4. Access the app:
    Open a browser and browse to http://localhost:5000.


## Guide
### Read Plate Page
1. Open the InnoPlateReader app, then click the Start Now button.
2. Open the “Read Plate” page on the website.
2. Upload an image of the vehicle with the license plate.
3. Click the “Process” button.
4. License plate detection results will be displayed.
5. You can save the detection result.

### Upgrade Model Page
1. Open the InnoPlateReader app, then click the Start Now button.
2. Open the “Upgrade Model” page on the website.
3. Upload the dataset of images and labels in .txt format.
4. Specify the preferred epoch and confidence values.
5. Click the “Train” button. Then wait for a while.
6. When finished, the system will display the confusion matrix of the model training results.
7. You can save the new model and use your model immediately.
